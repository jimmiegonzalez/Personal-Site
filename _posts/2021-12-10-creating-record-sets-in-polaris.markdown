**NOTE**: _Some information has been redacted or removed for privacy purposes._

Polaris Leap is a library management system that is used by libraries to manage their collections. In Polaris, you can create record sets to group together similar items, such as books, journals, or other materials. Here's how to create record sets in Polaris:

# Log in

Log in to Polaris with your username and password.

![Log in page](/assets/polaris/log-in.png "Log in page")

# Dashboard

From the main dashboard, click on the **New** tab and select **Record Set** from the dropdown menu.

A **New Record Set** window will then pop up. Click on the **Select Record Type** tab and choose **Item** from the dropdown menu.

# Record Set Components

You will then be redirected to a new page titled **New Item Record Set 1**. Take note of the following components in the image below:

1. **Name**: The **Name** field allows you to title the record set.

2. **Owner**: The **Owner** field will automatically contain the name of your library branch.

3. **Save**: The **Save** button will save and store any changes that have been made. **It is essential to save when a change or bulk change has been made**.

4. **Close**: The **Close** button will close the current window.

5. **Note**: The **Note** field allows you to input any comments or supplemental information that can better compartmentalize your record set.

6. **Barcode Field**: The **Barcode Field** allows you to register an item to your record set by scanning or entering a barcode.

7. **FIND TOOL**: the **FIND TOOL** allows you to filter through any inputted records based on item name, assigned branch, barcode, and record status.

# Conclusion

Once you have entered the corresponding information, click **SAVE** to create the new record set.

You can also find your recently created record set by going back to the Polaris home page and clicking on **FIND**:

![Find](/assets/polaris/find.png "Find")

Once the **FIND TOOL** opens up, click on the first search tab and select **Record Set**:

In the search field of the new window, type the name of your record set. A record set or a list of record sets with the same name or keyword will then be generated:
