<h3 style= "text-align: center">Hello and welcome!</h3>

<p>My name is Jimmie Gonzalez, and I graduated from the University of California, Riverside where I studied English, and honed my skills in writing, editing, proofreading, and attention to detail. However, Iâ€™ve always had an affinity for not only writing but technology as well. To satisfy my curiosity and desire to solve complex problems, I enrolled in a software engineering program where I worked with various Subject Matter Experts to design and deploy user-focused applications and learned software development standards and best practices. 
</p>

<p>While studying software engineering, I also took it upon myself to learn all facets of technical writing to bridge the gap between the complex concepts of software engineering and end users. Shortly after, I began doing freelance technical writing. I have had the opportunity to work with various companies and individuals by writing and reviewing their technical documentation to ensure that the final document is of the highest quality.</p>
